# RhythmNet-TT: Adaptive Arrhythmia Detection Beyond Training

This repository contains the code for RhythmNet-TT, a Transformer-based deep learning model for ECG arrhythmia detection.

## Description

RhythmNet-TT is a model that builds upon the ECG-DETR architecture . By incorporating a memory module inspired by the Memory as Context (MAC) framework . This adaptation aims to improve the model's ability to handle variability in ECG signals and process longer ECG sequences.

## Code Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* `source/`: Contains all code of models (`model_architectures.py`, `titan.py`), experiment training (`arg_extractor.py`, `experiment_builder.py`, `storage_utils.py`), utilities (`loss_functions.py`, `VisualiseResults.ipynb`), along with debugging files.

* `Kaggle_setup/`: Instructions and necessary files to obtain MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation dataset in our format (3 s, 7 s, 15 s).

* `./`: Pre-processing code for MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset (`Pre-preprocessing_MIT-BIH_Arrhythmia.py`), which requires csv files processed from `get_csv_MIT-BIH_Arrhithmia.ipynb`

## Dependencies

The code requires the following packages (python=3.12.5):
[numpy, scipy, matplotlib, jupyter, pytorch, torchvision, torchaudio]

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
